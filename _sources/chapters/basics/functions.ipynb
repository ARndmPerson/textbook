    "\n",
    "The difference is just the `rec` keyword. It's probably a bit surprising that\n",

    "though. (Nor does the Scheme family of languages.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best known recursive functions is the factorial function. In OCaml,\n",
    "it can be written as follows:\n",

    "[rules for lowercase identifiers][lowercase] can be found in the manual. The\n",
    "names `x1` through `xn` are metavariables indicating argument identifiers. These\n",
    "follow the same rules as function identifiers. The keyword `rec` is required if\n",
    "`f` is to be a recursive function; otherwise it may be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "[lowercase]: http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/lex.html#lowercase-ident\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that syntax for function definitions is actually simplified compared to\n",
    "what OCaml really allows. We will learn more about some augmented syntax for\n",
    "function definition in the next couple weeks. But for now, this simplified\n",
    "version will help us focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutually recursive functions can be defined with the `and` keyword:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec f x1 ... xn = e1\n",
    "and g y1 ... yn = e2\n",

    "let rec even n =\n",
    "  n = 0 || odd (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "(** [odd n] is whether [n] is odd.\n",
    "    Requires: [n >= 0]. *)\n",
    "and odd n =\n",
    "  n <> 0 && even (n - 1);;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ video_embed | replace(\"%%VID%%\", \"W0rO84YXIXo\")}}\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for function types is:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "t -> u\n",
    "t1 -> t2 -> u\n",
    "t1 -> ... -> tn -> u\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `t` and `u` are metavariables indicating types. Type `t -> u` is the type of\n",
    "a function that takes an input of type `t` and returns an output of type `u`. We\n",
    "can think of `t1 -> t2 -> u` as the type of a function that takes two inputs,\n",
    "the first of type `t1` and the second of type `t2`, and returns an output of\n",
    "type `u`. Likewise for a function that takes `n` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic semantics.** There is no dynamic semantics of function definitions.\n",
    "There is nothing to be evaluated. OCaml just records that the name `f` is bound\n",
    "to a function with the given arguments `x1..xn` and the given body `e`. Only\n",
    "later, when the function is applied, will there be some evaluation to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static semantics.** The static semantics of function definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For non-recursive functions: if by assuming that `x1 : t1` and `x2 : t2` and ...\n",

    "  `e : u`, then `f : t1 -> t2 -> ... -> tn -> u`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the type checking rule for recursive functions assumes that the\n",
    "function identifier `f` has a particular type, then checks to see whether the\n",

    "1. Evaluate `e0` to a function. Also evaluate the argument expressions `e1`\n",
