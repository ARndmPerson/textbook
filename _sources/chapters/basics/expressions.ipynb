    "The primary piece of OCaml syntax is the *expression*. Just like programs in\n",
    "imperative languages are primarily built out of *commands*, programs in\n",
    "functional languages are primarily built out of expressions. Examples of\n",
    "expressions include `2+2` and `increment 21`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCaml manual has a complete definition of [all the expressions in the\n",
    "language][exprs]. Though that page starts with a rather cryptic overview, if you\n",
    "scroll down, you'll come to some English explanations. Don't worry about\n",
    "studying that page now; just know that it's available for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "[exprs]:  https://ocaml.org/manual/expr.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary task of computation in a functional language is to *evaluate* an\n",
    "expression to a *value*. A value is an expression for which there is no\n",
    "computation remaining to be performed. So, all values are expressions, but not\n",
    "all expressions are values. Examples of values include `2`, `true`, and\n",
    "`\"yay!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCaml manual also has a definition of [all the values][values], though\n",
    "again, that page is mostly useful for reference rather than study.\n",
    "\n",
    "[values]: https://ocaml.org/manual/values.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes an expression might fail to evaluate to a value. There are two reasons\n",
    "that might happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluation of the expression raises an exception.\n",
    "2. Evaluation of the expression never terminates (e.g., it enters an \"infinite\n",
    "   loop\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `assert e` evaluates `e`. If the result is `true`, nothing more\n",
    "happens, and the entire expression evaluates to a special value called *unit*.\n",
    "The unit value is written `()` and its type is `unit`. But if the result is\n",
    "`false`, an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators\n",

    "Operators can be used to form expressions. OCaml has more or less all the usual\n",

    "* OCaml deliberately does not support operator overloading. As a consequence,\n",
    "  the integer and floating-point operators are distinct. E.g., to add integers,\n",
    "  use `+`. To add floating-point numbers, use `+.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two equality operators in OCaml, `=` and `==`, with corresponding\n",
    "  inequality operators `<>` and `!=`. Operators `=` and `<>` examine\n",
    "  *structural* equality whereas `==` and `!=` examine *physical* equality. Until\n",
    "  we've studied the imperative features of OCaml, the difference between them\n",
    "  will be tricky to explain. See the [documentation][stdlib] of `Stdlib.(==)`\n",
    "  if you're curious now.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Start training yourself now to use `=` and not to use `==`. This will be\n",
    "difficult if you're coming from a language like Java where `==` is the usual\n",
