    "# Expressions\n",

    "The primary piece of OCaml syntax is the *expression*. Just like programs in\n",
    "imperative languages are primarily built out of *commands*, programs in\n",
    "functional languages are primarily built out of expressions. Examples of\n",
    "expressions include `2+2` and `increment 21`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCaml manual has a complete definition of [all the expressions in the\n",
    "language][exprs]. Though that page starts with a rather cryptic overview, if you\n",
    "scroll down, you'll come to some English explanations. Don't worry about\n",
    "studying that page now; just know that it's available for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "[exprs]:  https://ocaml.org/manual/expr.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary task of computation in a functional language is to *evaluate* an\n",
    "expression to a *value*. A value is an expression for which there is no\n",
    "computation remaining to be performed. So, all values are expressions, but not\n",
    "all expressions are values. Examples of values include `2`, `true`, and\n",
    "`\"yay!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCaml manual also has a definition of [all the values][values], though\n",

    "[values]: https://ocaml.org/manual/values.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes an expression might fail to evaluate to a value. There are two reasons\n",
    "that might happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluation of the expression raises an exception.\n",
    "2. Evaluation of the expression never terminates (e.g., it enters an \"infinite\n",
    "   loop\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primitive Types and Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The *primitive* types are the built-in and most basic types: integers,\n",
    "floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and booleans. They will be\n",
    "recognizable as similar to primitive types from other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type `int`: Integers.** OCaml integers are written as usual: `1`, `2`, etc.\n",
    "The usual operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `mod`. The latter\n",

    "The answer is something we'll call the *Principle of Name Irrelevance*: the name\n",
    "of a variable shouldn't intrinsically matter. You're used to this from math. For\n",

    "```ocaml\n",
    "let f x = x * x\n",
    "let f y = y * y\n",
    "```\n",
    "This principle is more commonly known as *alpha equivalence*: the two functions\n",

    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 6 in x\n",
    "let y = 6 in y\n",

    "let x = 42 in\n",
    "  let x = 22 in\n",
    "    ... (* whatever else is typed in the toplevel *)\n",
    "```\n",

    "To summarize, each let definition binds an entirely new variable. If that new\n",
    "variable happens to have the same name as an old variable, the new variable\n",
