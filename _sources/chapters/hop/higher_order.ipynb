    "The phrase \"higher order\" is used throughout logic and computer science, though\n",
    "not necessarily with a precise or consistent meaning in all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In logic, *first-order quantification* refers primarily to the universal and\n",
    "existential ($\\forall$ and $\\exists$) quantifiers. These let you quantify over\n",
    "some *domain* of interest, such as the natural numbers. But for any given\n",
    "quantification, say $\\forall x$, the variable being quantified represents an\n",
    "individual element of that domain, say the natural number 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Second-order quantification* lets you do something strictly more powerful,\n",
    "which is to quantify over *properties* of the domain. Properties are assertions\n",
    "about individual elements, for example, that a natural number is even, or that\n",
    "it is prime. In some logics we can equate properties with sets of individual,\n",
    "for example the set of all even naturals. So second-order quantification is\n",
    "often thought of as quantification over *sets*. You can also think of properties\n",
    "as being functions that take in an element and return a Boolean indicating\n",
    "whether the element satisfies the property; this is called the *characteristic\n",
    "function* of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Third-order* logic would allow quantification over properties of properties,\n",
    "and *fourth-order* over properties of properties of properties, and so forth.\n",
    "*Higher-order logic* refers to all these logics that are more powerful than\n",
    "first-order logic; though one interesting result in this area is that all\n",
    "higher-order logics can be expressed in second-order logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages, *first-order functions* similarly refer to functions\n",
    "that operate on individual data elements (e.g., strings, ints, records,\n",
    "variants, etc.). Whereas *higher-order function* can operate on functions, much\n",
