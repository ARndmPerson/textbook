# Summary

This book is about becoming a better programmer.  Studying functional
programming will help with that.  The biggest obstacle in our way is
the frustration of speaking a new language, particularly letting go of
mutable state.  But the benefits will be great:  a discovery that
programming transcends programming in any particular language or family
of languages, an exposure to advanced language features, and an appreciation
of beauty.

## Further Reading

* [Introduction to Objective Caml](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf),
  chapters 1 and 2, a freely available textbook that is recommended for this course
* [OCaml from the Very Beginning](http://ocaml-book.com/), chapter 1, a textbook
  that is very gentle and recommended for this course. The [PDF](https://johnwhitington.net/ocamlfromtheverybeginning/mlbook.pdf) and [HTML](https://johnwhitington.net/ocamlfromtheverybeginning/index.html) formats of the book are free of charge.
* [A guided tour [of OCaml]](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/guided-tour.html):
  chapter 1 of *Real World OCaml*, a book written by some Cornellians
  that some students might enjoy reading
* [The history of Standard ML](http://sml-family.org/history/): though it focuses
  on the SML variant of the ML language, it's relevant to OCaml
* [The value of values](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values): a lecture
  by the designer of Clojure (a modern dialect of Lisp) on how the time of
  imperative programming has passed
* [Teach yourself programming in 10 years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html):
  an essay by a Director of Research at Google that puts the
  time required to become an educated programmer into perspective
