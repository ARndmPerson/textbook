# Example: Calculator

Let's start with a video guided tour of implementing an interpreter for a tiny
language: just a calculator, essentially, with addition and multiplication. The
point of this guided tour is not to go into great detail about any single piece
of it. Rather, the goal is to get a little familiarity with the OCaml tools and
techniques for lexing, parsing, and evaluation. They are all rather tightly
coupled, which makes it challenging to understand one piece without having a
high-level understanding of the whole. After we get that understanding from the
tour, we'll start over again in the next section (on parsing), and at that time
we'll dive into the details.
