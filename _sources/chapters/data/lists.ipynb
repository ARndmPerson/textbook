    "lists. That's a characteristic that OCaml shares with many other functional\n",
    "languages. Mainstream imperative languages, like Python, have such support these\n",
    "days too. Maybe that's because programmers find it so pleasant to work directly\n",

    "**Syntax.**  There are three syntactic forms for building lists:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[]\n",
    "e1 :: e2\n",
    "[e1; e2; ...; en]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The empty list is written `[]` and is pronounced \"nil\", a name that comes from\n",
    "Lisp. Given a list `lst` and element `elt`, we can prepend `elt` to `lst` by\n",
    "writing `elt :: lst`. The double-colon operator is pronounced \"cons\", a name\n",
    "that comes from an operator in Lisp that <u>cons</u>tructs objects in memory.\n",
    "\"Cons\" can also be used as a verb, as in \"I will cons an element onto the list.\"\n",
    "The first element of a list is usually called its *head* and the rest of the\n",
    "elements (if any) are called its *tail*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square bracket syntax is convenient but unnecessary. Any list\n",
    "`[e1; e2; ...; en]` could instead be written with the more primitive nil and\n",
    "cons syntax: `e1 :: e2 :: ... :: en :: []`. When a pleasant syntax can be\n",
    "defined in terms of a more primitive syntax within the language, we call the\n",
    "pleasant syntax *syntactic sugar*: it makes the language \"sweeter\". Transforming\n",
    "the sweet syntax into the more primitive syntax is called *desugaring*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the elements of the list can be arbitrary expressions, lists can be\n",
    "nested as deeply as we like, e.g., `[[[]]; [[1; 2; 3]]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic semantics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[]` is already a value.\n",
    " * If `e1` evaluates to `v1`, and if `e2` evaluates to `v2`, then `e1 :: e2`\n",
    "  evaluates to `v1 :: v2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of those rules and how to desugar the square-bracket notation\n",
    "for lists, we have the following derived rule:\n",
    "\n",
    " * If `ei` evaluates to `vi` for all `i` in `1..n`, then `[e1; ...; en]`\n",
    "  evaluates to `[v1; ...; vn]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's starting to get tedious to write \"evaluates to\" in all our evaluation\n",
    "rules. So let's introduce a shorter notation for it. We'll write `e ==> v` to\n",
    "mean that `e` evaluates to `v`. Note that `==>` is not a piece of OCaml syntax.\n",
    "Rather, it's a notation we use in our description of the language, kind of like\n",
    "metavariables. Using that notation, we can rewrite the latter two rules above:\n",
    "\n",
    " * If `e1 ==> v1`, and if `e2 ==> v2`, then `e1 :: e2 ==> v1 :: v2`.\n",
    " * If `ei ==> vi` for all `i` in `1..n`, then `[e1; ...; en] ==> [v1; ...; vn]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static semantics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the elements of a list must have the same type. If that element type is `t`,\n",
    "then the type of the list is `t list`. You should read such types from right to\n",
    "left: `t list` is a list of `t`'s, `t list list` is a list of list of `t`'s,\n",
    "etc. The word `list` itself here is not a type: there is no way to build an\n",
    "OCaml value that has type simply `list`. Rather, `list` is a *type constructor*:\n",
    "given a type, it produces a new type. For example, given `int`, it produces the\n",
    "type `int list`. You could think of type constructors as being like functions\n",
    "that operate on types, instead of functions that operate on values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type-checking rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[] : 'a list`\n",
    "* If `e1 : t` and `e2 : t list` then `e1 :: e2 : t list`. In case the colons\n",
    "  and their precedence is confusing, the latter means `(e1 :: e2) : t list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rule for `[]`, recall that `'a` is a type variable: it stands for an\n",
    "unknown type. So the empty list is a list whose elements have an unknown type.\n",
    "If we cons an `int` onto it, say `2 :: []`, then the compiler infers that for\n",
    "that particular list, `'a` must be `int`. But if in another place we cons a\n",
    "`bool` onto it, say `true :: []`, then the compiler infers that for that\n",

    "   amount of memory in use does not increase&mdash;beyond the one extra piece of\n",
    "   memory needed to store `h + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the compiler does the latter. So there's no need for concern. The\n",
